People
Are you going to tag speaker names as <persName>
Yes
No
Why/why not?
Most people haven’t. Also seems unimportant to information in the documents. 
Are you going to tag all references to a person in the interview?
Yes
No
Why/why not?
Yes, we decided to tag every reference to the person in order to organize and sort the document more cohesively. It make the process of encoding easier and categorizing and finding information much easier. 
Are you going to tag all implicit references to a person (via pronoun or other non-naming reference like ‘that man’)
Yes
No
Why/why not?
	We decided not to tag all implicit references to a person because there are too many items to tag in each document. We do think that important implicit references should be tagged, but not every single one. We came to the consensus that pronoun usage to important references in stand-alone sentences were important to tag. 
Other ideas/suggestions?


Places
Are you going to tag all references to the same place in an interview?
Yes
No
Why/why not?
Similar to tagging all references to people in an interview, the document can better be organized and sorted when investigating specific mentions of places.
How do you manage places and relative places (e.g., must a place be named
Are you going to tag all implicit references to a place (via non-naming reference like ‘that place’, ‘the street’, ‘home’)
Yes
No
Why/why not?
It gives context to the implicit references without a need to go back through and read the context.
