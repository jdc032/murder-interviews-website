# Summary of Interview

After analyzing the interview, I came across tension and confusion surrounding what did and didn’t occur during the time before and after Taylor’s murder. In the interview, Mary Miles Minter expresses Marshall Neilan’s concerns about Taylor’s mental state and presents several instances where Taylor made either completely false or complicated claims. The primary example of this discussed in the interview was one in which Taylor insisted that Neilan’s ex-wife had confronted Gloria Swanson at the Sunset Inn, however, Gloria does not recall this event ever occurring, nor was Neilan ever there when this allegedly occurred. Another instance mentioned in the interview was one of which Taylor claimed that Blanche Sweet had sent him an obscure letter, which when confronted about it, stated that it was only a thank-you note. Another allegation that came from Taylor was one claiming that Mary Miles Minter had come into his apartment undressed. She had allegedly come seeking his affection, but he rejected her. Neilan believes these rather obscure incidents demonstrate the poor mental state of Taylor. However, we never see the response of Mary Miles Minter to this allegation in my part of the interview. Her response to this claim could indicate the validity of this claim and those previous, however it is not disclosed in this part of the interview.  Mary Miles Minter, the interviewee, has a particularly close relationship to William Desmond Taylor. She confessed earlier in the interview that she is in love with Taylor, and she is also the recipient of the allegation expressed above. This indicates that she may have a relatively great deal of information regarding the murder, and the events that occurred before and after this fateful incident took place.
